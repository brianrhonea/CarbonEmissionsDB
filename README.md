Here is an acadmemic project I worked on in my first semester of my Master's Program. This analysis evaluates automotive carbon emission data using SQL. This was a group of 5 that collaborated on this project, I led many group meetings and wrote much of the code in the CarbonEmission.sql file. 

📌 Project Objectives

•	Analyze carbon emissions across the US automotive industry.
•	Identify key drivers of emissions.
•	Assess risks associated with current emission levels.
•	Recommend mitigation strategies for high-emission sectors.
•	Support development of carbon reduction policies with evidence-based insights.
•	Establish monitoring frameworks to track progress in emission reduction initiatives.
•	Facilitate knowledge sharing and capacity-building for stakeholders.

🛠️ Scope

The transportation industry is the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions globally, with CO2 accounting for 97% of transportation-related emissions. This project aims to:
	•	Collect and analyze carbon emissions data from the automotive industry.
	•	Benchmark emissions against industry standards.
	•	Identify emission hotspots and sources.
	•	Develop tailored, actionable strategies for reducing emissions.

📑 Deliverables

1.	Comprehensive Analysis Report: Insights into carbon emissions across the automotive sector.
2.	Mitigation Strategies: Recommendations to reduce emissions in high-polluting areas.
3.	Policy Support: Evidence-based guidance for industry-specific carbon reduction initiatives.
4.	Monitoring Framework: Tools to track emission reduction progress.
5.	Knowledge Sharing Materials: Resources for professionals in the automotive industry.

💼 Stakeholders

•	Industry representatives
•	Environmental agencies
•	Policymakers
•	Stakeholder organizations

⚠️ Risks and Mitigation Strategies

•	Risk: Data availability and reliability issues
•	Mitigation: Ensure data confidentiality and collaborate with experts.
•	Risk: Technical challenges in analysis and modeling
•	Mitigation: Use advanced techniques and secure necessary resources.
•	Risk: Resource constraints
•	Mitigation: Allocate budget and time effectively.

🔄 Project Timeline and Key Milestones

Phase 1: Data Collection (February–March 2024)
	•	Collect industry data.
	•	Create initial data tables and queries.

Phase 2: Analysis and Modeling (March–April 2024)
	•	Build database structures and ER diagrams.
	•	Conduct SQL queries, procedures, triggers, and functions development.

Phase 3: Deliverables and Presentation (April 2024)
	•	Finalize data analysis and compile the report.
	•	Present findings and submit documentation.

📝 SQL Use Cases Overview

1.	Top 5 Vehicles by GHG Score: Identifies alternative fuel technologies.
2.	Average CO2 Emissions by Fuel Type: Highlights the most polluting sources.
3.	Top 10 Vehicles by CO2 Emissions: Pinpoints opportunities for emission reduction.
4.	Total Annual Fuel Cost: Links fuel costs to emissions for cost-effective strategies.
5.	GHG Score Trends: Tracks industry-wide improvements in emissions.

🔧 Procedures and Functions

•	Procedure Examples:
•	Calculate total annual fuel cost per vehicle.
•	Insert new vehicle entries efficiently.
•	Function Examples:
•	Identify the vehicle with the lowest CO2 emissions.
•	Compute average CO2 emissions by fuel type.
